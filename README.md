# docker-compose.yaml

**Docker compose is a tool to manage multiple containers**

_docker-compose --version_

Docker Compose expects an yaml file **docker-compose.yaml** with details of containers to be started. By default, it looks for **docker-compose.yaml** unless it is specified with **--f** option.

**Basic Docker Compose operations**
```
docker-compose up
docker-compose stop
docker-compose down
```
